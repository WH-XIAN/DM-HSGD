# DM-HSGD

This is the code to reproduce the robust logistic regression experiment in the paper "A Faster Decentralized Algorithm for Nonconvex Minimax Problems" in NeurIPS 2021. The code is run on Python 3.6. The parallelization and communication is based on MPI. 

## Environment 
```
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

## Running
```
python Decentralized_Minimax.py
```
